What is Random Acts Generator?
Random Acts Generator is a web application that will help people with a random kind act. This app is named as Justhelp.

What does Justhelp do?
Justhelp allows users to create a profile and login to the system using their email and password. When the user logs into the system using his credentials, a home page will be displayed. The home page will have a random kind act displayed. The user can choose to generate another random act by the click of a button. The user can add, update , delete and view kind acts. He can also add, update, delete and view contacts for whom he would like to perform a kind act.

Technologies Used
The front-end of Justhelp was built using React and Redux.

Project Goal
The goal of this project was to deliver an MVP version of Justhelp in 4 days. While not a fully completed project, Justhelp is currently in a stage that is usable - making for an adequate MVP.

Project Stage
This project is still in an early stage. While the base functionality works, the app still needs both bug resolving and style polishing.

Known Issues
Currently there are no known bugs. The website needs work to be made responsive.
